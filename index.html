      <article>In 2014, I began my time at Missouri State University in Springfield, MO. I can remember first meeting my SOAR leader to decide which education path I would follow. I was choosing between Computer Science and Psychology. 
         If you'd like to skip reading this section, I'll point out now that I chose Psychology and have since been working on my technical skills. I digress.
          In my first year of college I joined a fraternity and fell in love with the stereotypical fraternity lifestyle. After dropping out in my sophomore year, I realized I needed to reevaluate my priorities and take responsibility for my actions.
         I reenrolled at Missouri State University and wrapped up the last few years on the Dean's List. In my last year, I approached a professor about his course and was offered the opportunity to join his research team. I hopped on the opportunity and 
      was then urged to apply to the graduate program with the help of that's professor's letter of recommendation. I was accepted - giving my a couple more years to figure out exactly what I wanted to do with my life.</article>

      <article>In 2019, I began my studies in Missouri State University's Master of Industrial-Organizational Psychology program, one of the top 10 in the country (yes, that's a subtle brag). I found myself in a cohort of 8 individuals. 
         To this day, they are some of the hardest working people I know, and I'm blessed to call them peers. We all struggled through the program, spending countless hours staying up studying together on campus. Imposter syndrome is no joke!
      We spent semesters studying EEOC, personality, assessment, training and development, personnel selection, and so on. As challenging as the course was, it was all worth it in the end. We all graduated in 2021 and went our separate ways to pursue careers studying the workforce (and hopefully helping it).</article>
      <h2 id="postGrad"><span style ="color: red">Post-</span><span style ="color: white"> Academic</span><span style ="color: blue"> Life</span></h2>
      <article>Since graduating in 2021, I have held a couple of jobs. My first job as a Talent Acquisition Specialist afforded me the opportunity to apply some of my hard-earned knowledge and skills from grad school to a sort of recruiting gig.
         My day-to-day mostly consisted of recruiting IT talent for various organizations in the Midwest and Northeast. Other than that, I got to work on process improvement, documentation, and knowledge management. After awhile, I realized that external recruiting
         was not for me, so I left to join another company as (you guessed it) a Technical Recruiter. Technical recruiting was certainly not my first choice as a line of work, but the company I found was too good to pass up. Between the people, the development opportunities, and the rewards structure,
         I've certainly been blessed with this opportunity. Now I primarily spend my days recruiting software developers for some of the nation's most reputable companies. Not only do I talk software development all day, I also have the privilege of working with some of
         the brightest minds in Sain Louis, MO. Every chance I get, I start up conversations and ask a million questions to better understand the tech industry. Conversation will only get you so far though, so as of 2023 I've enrolled in a Software Development program at my local community
         college as well as in the LaunchCode Web Dev program.

      <footer>TL;DR - In college, I picked Psychology over Computer Science. I've been working my way back ever since.</footer>
